HomeWork part #1

• Create namespace monitoring
• Create service account grabber in that namespace
• Create role that can get, list, watch on all Pods in the cluster

HomeWork part #2

• Deploy any Stateful application on Kubernetes as StatefulSet. If you have no ideas, you can use minio.


HomeWork part #3

• Complete chart of the simple application from the lecture. It should be configurable with values. At least you should implement:
• Number of replicas
• Labels
• Network ports
• Resource names should have similar pattern, for example app-svc and app-ingress
• Resources (it should be optional)
• Any other change that will make code cleaner and avoid repetition
